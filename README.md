## 🚀 Project Overview

This project aims to build a **Price Predictor System** using best practices in **Data Science, Machine Learning, and MLOps**.  
The focus is not on using many models, but on **building one well-tested, well-understood, and deployable model**.

---

## 🔍 Key Objectives

- Perform **thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to extract meaningful insights and build compelling data stories.
- Apply **feature engineering** with a deep understanding of *why* features are created and *how* they impact the model.
- Train and validate **a single robust machine learning model** using rigorous evaluation techniques.
- Write **scalable, defensive, and readable code**, following clean architecture and design patterns.
- Integrate **MLOps practices** for experiment tracking, versioning, and deployment.

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

- RMSE
- MAE
- R² Score

---

## 🔁 Experiment Tracking

All experiments, parameters, metrics, and models are tracked using **MLflow**, ensuring reproducibility and transparency.

---

## 📦 MLOps Integration

- **ZenML** is used to orchestrate pipelines
- **MLflow** manages experiments and model versions
- Designed to be easily extended for CI/CD and deployment

---
